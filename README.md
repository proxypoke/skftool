This is a small tool written in Python, using PyQt. It is specifically written
for the quarterly Season Kickoff Frenzy, a small event I started about two
years ago. It boils down to watching unhealthy amounts of first episodes from
the starting Anime season in random order while eating japanese food more or
less appropriate for the time of the year.

tl;dr: **weeaboo stuff**
